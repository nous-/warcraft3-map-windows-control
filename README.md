## war3remap

Remap the Left Windows key to Control, for Windows users.

I wrote this for playing Warcraft 3 on Windows. This is a built in option on OSX, but not on Windows, so here is the tool to do it. It strictly rebinds the key so this can be used for non-war3 cases.

My default position on internet binaries is non-trust. However, I set this up to be something I might even download and run. So short of reviewing and compiling the code yourself, you can see github machines are doing the work of building the binaries out of the source. That might work for you.

Enjoy

> PS Setting your keys to `grid` in game, also maps the the hero inventory items map to T, Y, G, H, B, N. Had no idea.
